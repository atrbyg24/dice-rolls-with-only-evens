A program to simulate the results of the following dice problem paradox:

You throw a fair six-sided die until you get 6. What is the expected
number of throws (including the throw giving 6) conditioned on the event
that all throws gave even numbers?

The program also explores some generalizations of the problem:
-rolling until obtaining a total of n 6s where n > 1
-rolling until obtaining n consecutive 6s where n > 1
